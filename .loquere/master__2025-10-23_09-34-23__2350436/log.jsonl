It evolved from Attic Greek and became the lingua franca of the Mediterranean world under the Macedonian and Roman empires. Koine is particularly significant because it is the language in which the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament were written. It bridges classical Greek and modern Greek, incorporating elements from various Greek dialects and showing some influence from other languages due to the wide geographic spread of its use.
