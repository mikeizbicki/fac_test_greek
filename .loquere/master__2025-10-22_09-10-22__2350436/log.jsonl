The word for owl in Koine Greek is \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u1fe6\u03be (glaux). \n\nSo, you would need to update the `about.json` file in the `characters/Owl` directory with this transliterated name.\n\nTo achieve this, you should:\n1. Open `./characters/Owl/about.json`\n2. Update the \"name\" field to \"Glaux\" (or your preferred transliteration)\n\nTo create `about.json` if it doesn't exist, you can use the `fac_build` function.\n\nSince you're working with a specific target, let's assume it's managed by `fac.yaml`. You should check the target name for `about.json` in `fac.yaml`. \n\nLet's try to build the target for `about.json`.\n", "cost": 0.0, "usage": {"groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct": {"text/out": 207, "text/in": 1397}}}
