Vocabulary:
- Use simple vocabulary.
  For example:
    - words from the New Testament
    - words with English/Spanish cognates
    - words that have regular declinations/conjugations
- Reuse words many times in different contexts.
  (Showing the same word in different declensions can be particularly useful.)

Grammar:
- Present tense verbs only
- Word order follows English
- Simple sentences
- Try to use a word in as many declensions as possible
    - try to always use the nominative/accusative declensions first
    - the genitive/dative declensions should only be used after a word has been used in the nominative or accusative (but preferably both)
