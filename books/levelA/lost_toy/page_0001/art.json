  "art_instructions": "From a child’s eye level inside a cozy panda home, depict a very still, quiet scene with no motion lines. Place Brephos (baby panda, chibi ~2.5 heads tall) slightly left of center on a soft oval floor mat, sitting upright with a calm, small smile and relaxed eyes; his bamboo‑green blanket is draped over his lap and lightly held in both paws. Set the little bell rattle present but silent: on the floor just to Brephos’s right, a hand’s width away, handle pointing toward him, not touching his paws. Arrange landmarks for the room: a low round table is to the left with clear open space beneath; a woven basket sits to the right with a couple of soft toys peeking in; behind Brephos at left is a low bed with a neutral cover; on the back wall to the right, a simple wooden door is slightly ajar. Use soft morning light from the right (window out of frame) for gentle highlights and minimal shadows, keeping the palette pastel with bamboo‑green as the single saturated accent (the blanket). Keep the composition simple and balanced with generous negative space to emphasize quiet; no adults are present in frame. Apply the Korean aegyo cute style: rounded shapes, smooth monoline strokes, large glossy eyes, tiny mouth, and minimal cel shading.",
