  "art_instructions": "Child’s-eye view at floor level in a cozy room: center the Panda (chibi panda cub with large dark eye patches, black ear tufts, round belly) sitting cross‑legged on a round pastel mint rug, angled three‑quarters to the right with the head turned toward the viewer in a welcoming “behold” smile. Panda’s right paw holds up a tiny wooden peg‑doll person, and the left paw nudges another on the floor to show active play. Place four “little people” total—simple wooden peg dolls with dot eyes and painted clothes—arranged in a neat semicircle directly in front of Panda: pink dress, blue shirt, yellow shirt, and lavender dress; each figure is about one‑fifth of Panda’s head height. Keep the dolls close to Panda’s paws (within a paw’s length) so their smallness is obvious. To Panda’s left, include a shallow wicker toy basket with one or two extra neutral peg dolls peeking out, and a couple of pastel building blocks, but keep the background minimal: a soft wall, a low table leg far right, and a gentle floor gradient. Expression is cheerful and focused; Panda’s eyes are bright with 2–3 highlights, tiny mouth, and faint blush dots. Lighting is diffuse top‑front; use flat pastel colors, clean monoline charcoal outlines (2–4 px at 1080p), and minimal soft cel shading with a faint floor contact shadow under Panda and the dolls. Composition is centered with generous negative space and clear silhouettes so young readers can easily match “Panda” and the “little people” to the scene.",
