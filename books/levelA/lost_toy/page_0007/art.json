  "art_instructions": "Draw Panda and Dinosaur standing side by side in a cozy indoor setting, likely the family room or kitchen. Both characters should appear alert and engaged, with open, searching expressions. Panda looks slightly sad but determined, ears forward, eyes wide, scanning the area. Dinosaur stands upright with a friendly, encouraging smile, one arm extended slightly as if offering help. Use a warm, pastel color palette with smooth gradients in the background. Keep the art style consistent with Korean aegyo cute: rounded, smooth lines, minimal detail, and monoline strokes. Ensure both characters are drawn from a low camera angle, approximately 2â€“3 heads tall. Position them so they appear ready to move, with space around them suggesting continuation of a search. Add soft ambient occlusion under their feet for gentle grounding. Text is not included in this art file. Future pages will show them actually searching under furniture; reuse character poses and expressions here to show the moment of agreement to seek together.",
