  "art_instructions": "From a child’s eye level just above the floor, show Panda sitting cross‑legged on a pastel play mat in the cozy living room, centered in the frame at a 3/4 angle facing right with a gentle, focused smile. Panda’s left paw delicately pinches a tiny “mother” figurine to show how small it is (smaller than his paw), while his right paw rests near three more little human figures arranged in a neat row directly in front of him. The three standing figures, left to right, are father, brother, and sister; each is about the height of Panda’s ear and clearly shorter than his paw, with soft, sticker‑like clarity and small soft shadows. Give the mother a pink dress and tiny bun; the father a blue shirt and brown pants; the brother a green shirt and shorts; the sister a yellow dress with a small bow—each with simple dot eyes and minimal details in chibi peg‑style. Keep the background simple and low: cropped legs of a low wooden table at the top edge and a soft baseboard; no adult heads or upper bodies in frame. Lighting is diffuse and gentle; use pastel tones with one saturated accent on each figure’s outfit for readability. Leave airy negative space above the toys so their smallness reads clearly, and avoid adding other characters or props.",
