# Art Style Guide (Korean Aegyo Cute)

Use a Korean aegyo “cute” style with chibi proportions (2–3 heads tall), rounded silhouettes, and minimal detail; favor smooth monoline strokes (line weight ≈ 2–4 px at 1080p, or ~1–2% of character height), using dark brown/charcoal rather than pure black, with occasional colored line art for soft areas. Apply flat pastel palettes (high value, low–medium saturation) with a single saturated accent color for focal points; shading should be minimal: 1–2 steps of soft cel-shade plus a faint, warm ambient occlusion under overlaps. Eyes are large and widely spaced with simple irises and 2–3 glossy highlights; noses and mouths are tiny, with optional blush dots; avoid sharp corners, heavy texture, or complex materials. Favor sticker-like clarity: clean edges, consistent line weight, and optional white keyline or soft drop shadow for separation. Backgrounds remain simple and airy (flat shapes, soft gradients, gentle patterns), with generous negative space and gentle vignettes; compositions are centered or symmetrically balanced, emphasizing approachable, open poses and readable silhouettes. Lighting is diffuse top-front; avoid harsh contrast, strong rim lights, or dramatic shadows. If text appears, use rounded sans-serif/bubble lettering with ample tracking and high contrast against the ground, keeping all elements vector-friendly and exportable at 2× scale for crisp screens.
