Formatting:
- Write all Greek with proper Koine diacritics and punctuation.
- Do not provide any transliterations unless asked.
- Follow standard English capitalization rules (by capitalizing proper nouns and the first word in a sentence).
- Avoid using Arabic numerals (e.g. 1, 2, 3) and prefer writing out the full Greek word.
