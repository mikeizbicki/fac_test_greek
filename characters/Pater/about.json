  "name": "Pater",
  "description": "A patient, practical panda father who models clear Koine action language and gentle sequencing, always depicted from the waist down.",
  "sex": "male",
  "personality": "Calm, encouraging, and methodical, he guides children through tasks with simple, concrete verbs and step-by-step cues. He notices small problems early and turns them into playful chances to count, measure, and fix together.",
  "backstory": "Raised in a tidy forest workshop, Nikolaos learned to see patterns—first in bamboo stalks, then in tools and numbers. He and Sophia built a warm home where Koine is everyday speech, and hospitality is the rule. As a community helper, he repairs neighbors’ wagons and garden gates, inviting little paws to hold nails, count boards, and echo verbs. He believes confidence grows when children do real work in small, safe steps.",
  "appearance": "A sturdy panda with broad, gentle paws; in illustrations his face is never shown—only hands and lower body from the child’s eye level. He wears forest‑green work trousers, a leather belt with a small measuring stick, and a pocketed apron that ties low. Red‑and‑white striped socks peek above well‑worn brown boots, and wood shavings often cling to his cuffs. A simple wristwatch and a cloth tape measure at his hip provide quick visual cues for timing and counting.",
