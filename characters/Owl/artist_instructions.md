# Glaux (Owl) — Artist Instructions

Glaux is a small, round-bodied owl with large, round amber eyes (dark brown pupils) set in a pale cream facial disk edged with light brown. Her feathers are mottled brown-and-cream: back and wings are a warm medium brown with darker umber speckles, while her chest, belly, and inner wings are light cream with soft brown flecks. She has a small pale tan beak and yellow‑ochre feet with charcoal‑gray talons. Her head is smoothly rounded with no visible ear tufts, and her tail is short.
