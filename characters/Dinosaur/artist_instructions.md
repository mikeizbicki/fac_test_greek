# Dinosaur — Artist Instructions

Draw Dinosaur as a child-sized green dinosaur with smooth pea-green scales and a pale mint belly that runs from the lower jaw down the chest and along the underside of the tail; he has a round snout and a short tail. Small triangular dorsal nubs in a slightly darker green form a single row from the back of his head to mid‑tail. His eyes are large and expressive with dark brown irises, black pupils, and a small white highlight; he has two small oval nostrils and a wide smile with a soft pink mouth interior and tongue when open. Each hand and foot has three stubby, clawless digits that match the body color, with lighter mint pads, and his stance is upright and friendly.
