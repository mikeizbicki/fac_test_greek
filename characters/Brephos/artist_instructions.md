# Brephos â€” Always-Drawn Appearance

Brephos is a round-faced baby panda with a plush black-and-white coat: creamy white face, muzzle, and belly; deep charcoal eye patches; soft charcoal ears; and charcoal forearms and legs. His eyes are wide and gleaming dark brown with black pupils, paired with a small black nose and a tiny pink tongue that may peek out when he concentrates. His paws are small, rounded, and dimpled to emphasize his baby age. He always wears a simple cream cloth bib bearing a small single leaf motif in fresh green.
