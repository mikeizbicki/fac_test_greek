  "backstory": "Meter grew up in a valley where grandparents shared stories, songs, and everyday Koine around the table. When she moved to the woodland, she carried those sounds with her and began a family. She keeps the language alive in small moments—setting the table, tidying toys, greeting neighbors. Her hope is that her cubs will hear Greek as comfort, connection, and joy.",
  "appearance": "A round, soft panda with flour-dusted paws and a gentle, steady smile. She often wears a light apron stitched with simple Greek letters and tiny berry leaves. A woven basket rests in the crook of her arm, and she moves slowly, often crouching or kneeling to be eye-level with little ones.",

  "relationships": "Pater is her gentle partner who shares chores and stories. Paidion is her curious cub whom she guides with playful Greek. Bebē is the baby panda she soothes and sings to at naptime. Geiton is a helpful neighbor who trades berries and practices phrases with the family."
