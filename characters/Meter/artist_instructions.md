A gentle adult panda with classic black-and-white markings: white face and muzzle, black rounded ears, black eye patches, black forearms and paws, and a white belly with black legs. She is always dressed in a sky-blue skirt, secured with a simple braided sash in natural tan. Her paws and forearms are visible at the sleeves as she moves, and she wears soft house sandals in light brown on her feet. A small strand of honey-brown wooden beads rests near her hip, subtly visible from most angles.
