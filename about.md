# About This Series

A warm, story-forward introduction to Koine Greek, these picture-book–length tales follow a gentle family of panda bears who speak Greek at home and in their woodland community. Each book pairs cozy narratives with comprehensible input, high‑frequency vocabulary, and playful repetition so that young readers naturally absorb the sounds, structures, and joy of the language.

## Who It’s For (Target Audience)

- Children ages 4–10, with no prior Greek required.

## What Makes It Unique (Features)

- Story-first Koine: Narrative drives the language. Each scene centers on everyday actions (greetings, meals, chores, play) expressed with high-frequency Koine forms and phrases.
- Comprehensible input design: Controlled vocabulary, predictable sentence frames, and rich visual context enable understanding without constant translation.
- Gentle grammar scaffolding: Books progress from simple clauses and present-tense actions to questions, imperatives, prepositions, and select aorist forms—always embedded in story and recycled repeatedly.
- Repetition with purpose: Key words and patterns recur across pages and titles, spiraling for durable acquisition.
- Visual cues and icons: “Point-and-say,” “Act it out,” and “Listen and echo” icons prompt TPR-style movement and interactive play.

## Children-first Perspective

All stories are told and art is drawn are from a kids perspective.

In particular:
- Art should be drawn low to the ground as if a 4 year old is viewing the scene.
- Adults heads are never drawn (because they will be out of the frame above).  Only elbows and below will be drawn for adults.
